# Targeted Syntactic Evaluation for Galician-Portuguese (PROPOR 2022)
This repositotory contains the datasets and scripts of the paper _A Targeted Assessment of the Syntactic Abilities
of Transformer Models for Galician-Portuguese_, to be presented at the [PROPOR 2022](https://sites.universidadedefortaleza.com/propor2022/) Conference.

## Datasets
The folder _dataset_ includes the datasets for Galician (gl) and Portuguese (pt).

## Scripts
The folder _scripts_ contains the scripts the run the models on the datasets (run_[exp].py) and to generate the results from the outputs of the models (eval_[exp].py).

To replicate the results, execute the _run_ scripts with the desired datasets and models, and then run the _eval_ scripts on the output generated by the _run_ scripts. Please check the first lines of each script to know how to run them.
